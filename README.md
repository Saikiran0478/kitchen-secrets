# Kitchen Secrets – Unveiling India's Culinary Heritage (Rasoi Raaz)

---

## Project Overview

**Kitchen Secrets** (Rasoi Raaz) is a community-driven, open-source **Streamlit application** dedicated to preserving and celebrating India’s diverse family recipes. It allows users to share regional culinary knowledge via **text, images, audio, and video**, ensuring traditional recipes are archived and passed on for generations.

It also acts as a **"Corpus Collection Engine"**, capturing rich, multimodal, multilingual culinary data from everyday Indian kitchens.

## Features (MVP)

* **Multi-format Recipe Submission:** Submit recipes through:

  * Text (typed or handwritten)
  * Images (dishes, handwritten notes)
  * Audio (narrations)
  * Video (cooking walkthroughs)

* **Geo Coordinates Capture:** Automatically or manually capture location (latitude, longitude) with each submission.

* **User Details:** Collect contributor info — name, email (optional), and demographics (optional).

* **Regional Categorization:** Tag recipes based on Indian states/regions.

* **Corpus Category Selection:** Users must choose the type of corpus being contributed:

  * Text
  * Image-Text Pair
  * Audio-Text Pair
  * Video-Text Pair

* **File + Description Input:** All uploads include both the media file and a description (ingredients, process, context).

* **Interactive Browsing:** Filter by region, format, or popularity.

* **Reactions & Comments:** Engage with likes, hearts, and comments.

* **Point System:** Earn points for uploading and interacting.

* **Offline-First Design:** Supports queuing uploads offline and syncing later.

* **Optimized Media Uploads:** Client-side compression ensures uploads are bandwidth-friendly.

* **Multilingual Interface:** UI is localized in major Indian languages.

* **Basic AI Assistance:** Suggests regional tags and extracts ingredients/instructions from text.

* **Data Collection:**
  The app **collects and stores** all data submitted by users — including **text, images, audio, video, geo-coordinates, user info, and metadata** — for the purpose of creating a **searchable, multilingual, multimodal corpus of Indian recipes**.

## Corpus Contribution

Every submission enriches a growing **AI-ready corpus** that supports cultural preservation and future research. Each entry includes:

* Media Content (Text, Images, Audio, Video)
* Geo Coordinates (Latitude, Longitude)
* User Details (Name, optional demographic info)
* Corpus Category (Text, Image-Text, etc.)
* Recipe Metadata (Region, language/dialect, format, file type)
* Structured Description (Ingredients, steps, cultural context)

This data enables:

* **Cultural Archiving:** Preserving India’s culinary diversity.
* **AI Training:** Supporting future multilingual, multimodal NLP and vision models.
* **Cross-regional Insights:** Understanding food patterns, vocabularies, and regional identities.

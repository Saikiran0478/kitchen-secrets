# Kitchen Secrets üç≤ - Unveiling India's Culinary Heritage (Rasoi Raaz)

## Project Overview

*Kitchen Secrets* (also known as *Rasoi Raaz*) is a community-driven, open-source Streamlit application dedicated to preserving and celebrating the diverse family recipes of India. Our mission is to create an accessible platform where users can easily share their unique regional culinary traditions through text, images, audio, and video, ensuring these invaluable recipes are passed down for generations. By making it simple to contribute and explore, we aim to build a rich, multilingual corpus of Indian food knowledge, naturally generated by passionate home cooks across the country.

## Features (MVP)

* *Multi-format Recipe Submission:* Users can upload recipes as text, images (of dishes or handwritten recipes), or audio/video recordings of cooking processes/narrations.
* *Regional Categorization:* Recipes are categorized by their region/state of origin.
* *Interactive Browse:* Explore a growing collection of authentic Indian recipes.
* *Reactions & Comments:* Engage with recipes by liking, loving, and leaving comments.
* *Point System:* Earn points for contributing recipes and comments, fostering community engagement.
* *Offline-First Design:* View previously loaded recipes even without an internet connection. Pending uploads are queued and synced automatically when connectivity returns.
* *Optimized Media Uploads:* Client-side compression for images and videos to reduce data usage, making it friendly for low-bandwidth areas.
* *Basic AI-Powered Processing:* Initial AI integration to help parse ingredients/instructions from text and suggest regional tags post-submission.
* *Multilingual Interface:* Basic UI elements localized in key Indian languages, encouraging content submission in native dialects.

## Corpus Contribution

"Kitchen Secrets" is designed as a "Corpus Collection Engine." Every user submission, whether it's a text recipe in a local dialect, a narrated cooking video, or an image of a traditional dish with a vernacular description, directly contributes to building a unique and invaluable dataset. This corpus captures:

* *Regional Food Vocabulary:* Specific names for ingredients, dishes, and cooking techniques in diverse Indian languages.
* *Procedural Text:* Step-by-step cooking instructions.
* *Cultural Context:* Insights into culinary practices, traditions, and the stories behind recipes.
* *Multimedia Data:* Image-text and audio/video-text pairs, crucial for training future multimodal AI models for Indian languages and culinary understanding.

## Technical Stack

* *Frontend:* Streamlit
* *Backend/Data Storage:*
    * Recipe metadata: Flat files (JSON) for MVP, with potential for lightweight SQLite for more robust persistence.
    * Media files: Stored locally on the Hugging Face Space filesystem (for MVP).
    * Offline Queue: Browser's Local Storage/IndexedDB for pending uploads.
* *AI/NLP:*
    * Open-source Python libraries (e.g., spaCy for text parsing, basic rule-based parsing).
    * Client-side image/video compression libraries.
* *Deployment:* Hugging Face Spaces
